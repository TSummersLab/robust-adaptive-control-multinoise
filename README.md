# robust-adaptive-control-multinoise
Robust adaptive control via multiplicative noise from bootstrapped uncertainty estimates

There is no formal installation procedure; simply download the files and run them in a Python console.

## monte_carlo_comparison.py
Perform the simulation of the adaptive control algorithms.
Note that Ns = 100000 Monte Carlo samples will take several hours to run on a quadcore CPU.

## monte_carlo_comparison_loader_paper.py
Generate plots as shown in the paper from saved simulation results.

## monte_carlo_comparison_loader.py
Generate plots for diagnostic viewing from saved simulation results.
